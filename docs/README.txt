SDL_sound. An abstract soundfile decoder.

SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular sound file
 formats, such as .WAV and .MP3. It is meant to make the programmer's sound
 playback tasks simpler. The programmer gives SDL_sound a filename, or feeds
 it data directly from one of many sources, and then reads the decoded
 waveform data back at her leisure. If resource constraints are a concern,
 SDL_sound can process sound data in programmer-specified blocks. Alternately,
 SDL_sound can decode a whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the
 whole waveform. SDL_sound can also handle sample rate, audio format, and
 channel conversion on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes, if the programmer
 desires.

Please check the website for the most up-to-date information about SDL_sound:

SDL_sound _REQUIRES_ Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) 2.x to function, and cannot
 be built without it. You can get SDL from https://www.libsdl.org/. SDL_sound
 2.x only works with SDL2, and SDL_sound 1.x only works with SDL 1.x.
 Reports of success or failure are welcome.

Current versions of SDL_sound do not use any external libraries for decoding
 various file formats. All needed decoder source code is included with the
 library. Unless explicitly disabled during initial build configuration,
 SDL_sound always supports these file formats internally:

 - Wave (.WAV) files
 - MPEG-1 layers I-III (.MP3, .MP2, .MP1)
 - Ogg Vorbis (.OGG) files
 - Free Lossless Audio Codec (.FLAC) files
 - Audio Interchange format (.AIFF) files
 - Sun/NeXT Audio (.AU) files
 - Shorten (.SHN) files
 - Creative Labs Voice (.VOC) files
 - Various "module" formats (.MOD, .669, .AMF, .XM, .IT, .S3M, .STM, etc)
 - MIDI (.mid) files
 - ABC (.abc) files
 - Raw PCM data
 - (macOS/iOS only) anything that CoreAudio can decode.
