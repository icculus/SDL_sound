 *
 * The latest version of SDL_sound can be found at:
 *
 * https://icculus.org/SDL_sound/
 *
 * Note that SDL_sound is _not_ an official part of the SDL project, despite
 * its name.
 *
 * The basic gist of SDL_sound is that you use an SDL_IOStream to get sound
 * data into this library, and SDL_sound will take that data, in one of
 * several popular formats, and decode it into raw waveform data in the format
 * of your choice. This gives you a nice abstraction for getting sound into
 * your game or application; just feed it to SDL_sound, and it will handle
 * decoding and converting, so you can just pass it to your SDL audio callback
 * (or whatever). Since it gets data from an SDL_IOStream, you can get the
 * initial sound data from any number of sources: file, memory buffer, network
 * connection, etc.
 *
 * As the name implies, this library depends on SDL: Simple Directmedia Layer,
 * which is a powerful, free, and cross-platform multimedia library. It can be
 * found at https://www.libsdl.org/
 *
 * Support is in place for the following sound formats:
 *
 * - .WAV (Microsoft WAVfile RIFF data, internal.)
 * - .VOC (Creative Labs' Voice format, internal.)
 * - .MP3 (MPEG-1 Layer 3 support, via libmpg123.)
 * - .MID (MIDI music converted to Waveform data, internal.)
 * - .MOD (MOD files, via internal copy of libModPlug.)
 * - .OGG (Ogg files, via internal copy of stb_vorbis.)
 * - .SHN (Shorten files, internal.)
 * - .RAW (Raw sound data in any format, internal.)
 * - .AU (Sun's Audio format, internal.)
 * - .AIFF (Audio Interchange format, internal.)
 * - .FLAC (Lossless audio compression, via libFLAC.)

/**
 * Start decoding a new sound sample.
 *
 * The data is read via an SDL_IOStream structure (see SDL_iostream.h in
 * SDL3's include directory), so it may be coming from memory, disk, network
 * stream, etc. The (ext) parameter is merely a hint to determining the
 * correct decoder; if you specify, for example, "mp3" for an extension, and
 * one of the decoders lists that as a handled extension, then that decoder is
 * given first shot at trying to claim the data for decoding. If none of the
 * extensions match (or the extension is NULL), then every decoder examines
 * the data to determine if it can handle it, until one accepts it. In such a
 * case your SDL_IOStream will need to be capable of rewinding to the start of
 * the stream.
 *
 * If no decoders can handle the data, a NULL value is returned, and a human
 * readable error message can be fetched from Sound_GetError().
 *
 * Optionally, a desired audio format can be specified. If the incoming data
 * is in a different format, SDL_sound will convert it to the desired format
 * on the fly. Note that this can be an expensive operation, so it may be wise
 * to convert data before you need to play it back, if possible, or make sure
 * your data is initially in the format that you need it in. If you don't want
 * to convert the data, you can specify NULL for a desired format. The
 * incoming format of the data, preconversion, can be found in the
 * Sound_Sample structure.
 *
 * Note that the raw sound data "decoder" needs you to specify both the
 * extension "RAW" and a "desired" format, or it will refuse to handle the
 * data. This is to prevent it from catching all formats unsupported by the
 * other decoders.
 *
 * Finally, specify an initial buffer size; this is the number of bytes that
 * will be allocated to store each read from the sound buffer. The more you
 * can safely allocate, the more decoding can be done in one block, but the
 * more resources you have to use up, and the longer each decoding call will
 * take. Note that different data formats require more or less space to store.
 * This buffer can be resized later via Sound_SetBufferSize().
 *
 * The buffer size specified must be a multiple of the size of a single sample
 * frame. So, if you want 16-bit, stereo samples, then your sample frame size
 * is (2 channels * 16 bits), or 32 bits per frame, which is four bytes. In
 * such a case, you could specify 128 or 132 bytes for a buffer, but not 129,
 * 130, or 131 (although in reality, you'll want to specify a MUCH larger
 * buffer).
 *
 * When you are done with this Sound_Sample pointer, you can dispose of it via
 * Sound_FreeSample().
 *
 * You do not have to keep a reference to `io` around. If this function
 * suceeds, it stores `io` internally (and disposes of it during the call to
 * Sound_FreeSample()). If this function fails, it will dispose of the
 * SDL_IOStream for you.
 *
 * \param io an SDL_IOStream with sound data.
 * \param ext file extension normally associated with a data format. Can

/**
 * Seek to a different point in a sample.
 *
 * Reposition a sample's stream. If successful, the next call to
 * Sound_Decode() or Sound_DecodeAll() will give audio data from the offset
 * you specified.
 *
 * The offset is specified in milliseconds from the start of the sample.
 *
 * Beware that this function can fail for several reasons. If the SDL_IOStream
 * that feeds the decoder can not seek, this call will almost certainly fail,
 * but this can theoretically be avoided by wrapping it in some sort of
 * buffering SDL_IOStream. Some decoders can never seek, others can only seek
 * with certain files. The decoders will set a flag in the sample at creation
 * time to help you determine this.
 *
 * You should check `sample->flags & SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_CANSEEK` before
 * attempting. Sound_Seek() reports failure immediately if this flag isn't
 * set. This function can still fail for other reasons if the flag is set.
 *
 * This function can be emulated in the application with Sound_Rewind() and
 * predecoding a specific amount of the sample, but this can be extremely
 * inefficient. Sound_Seek() accelerates the seek with decoder-specific code.
 *
 * If this function fails, the sample should continue to function as if this
 * call was never made. If there was an unrecoverable error, `sample->flags &
 * SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_ERROR` will be set, which your regular decoding loop can
 * pick up.
 *
 * On success, SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_ERROR, SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_EOF, and
 * SOUND_SAMPLEFLAG_EAGAIN are cleared from `sample->flags`.
 *
 * \param sample the Sound_Sample to seek.
 * \param ms the new position, in milliseconds from start of sample.
 * \returns nonzero on success, zero on error. Specifics of the error can be
 *          gleaned from Sound_GetError().
 *
 * \threadsafety It is safe to call this function from any thread, but a
 *               single Sound_Sample should not be accessed from two threads
 *               at the same time.
