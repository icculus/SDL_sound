/*
 * CHANGELOG.
 */

09132001 - Initial spec proposed on SDL mailing list, under name "SDL_voice".
09142001 - Changed name to SDL_sound, added Sound_DecodeAll() to spec.
09172001 - Changed some overlooked "voice" to "sound". Implemented base API.
           So...tired. Everything's different.  :)
           Also put in a RAW decoder and a simple test program.
09182001 - Implemented MP3 support through SMPEG (not working yet, though) and
           wrote the Reference Counting RWops wrapper. Added other little
           things like the _D(()) macro. Added VOC support, which went up with
           surprisingly little struggle, which means it MUST be leaking
           memory.  :)
09192001 - Added a skeleton decoder source file. Changed voc_read() to
           voc_read_waveform(), so it wouldn't be confused with VOC_read().
           Fixed a byte ordering bug in voc.c (reported as AUDIO_S16LSB, but
           we were swapping byte order of data ourselves. Fixed). Added basic
           .WAV support. Fixed Makefile so that -I. is always first;
           otherwise, a previously installed header might get used for the
           compiles, which is not good. SDL_sound.h now includes SDL_endian.h,
           since SDL.h doesn't, for some reason. Moved version defines in
           SDL_sound.h to top of file so I can find them.  :)
           Changed version to 0.1.1. Committed patch from Tsuyoshi Iguchi to
           fix a segfault (I forgot to put a NULL terminator at the end of
           the available_decoders array), fixing the only bug preventing the
           test program from running on FreeBSD 4.3. Sweet. Added Ogg Vorbis
           decoder. Rewrote the test program's SDL audio callback to be more
           robust (Ogg exposed a nasty bug in it). Fixed a byte-ordering issue
           in the VOC decoder.
09202001 - Torbjörn Andersson submitted several patches: fixed a comment in
           the .WAV decoder (whoops...screwed up my own search-and-replace.
           Hah.), made an attempt at putting multiple sound streams behind
           one RWops (gotta think on that one first), and, most importantly,
           added an AIFF decoder, which is very cool.
09222001 - Torbjörn Andersson strikes again, with a collection of patches.
           First, some cosmetic tweaks for decoders/aiff.c. Next, a MOD player
           based on MikMod. This inspired me to add two more methods to
           Sound_DecoderFunctions: init() and quit(). Third, a fix to
           decoders/mp3.c so that SMPEG won't claim every stream it sees, MP3
           or not. I removed the multiple-streams-per-rwops code, after
           discussion on the mailing list. The init() and quit() methods
           led to the possibility that certain decoders will flag themselves
           as unavailable at runtime, and SDL_sound now handles this.
           Added [LIB|INC]PATH_[OGG|MOD]. Bigendian fixes; no works on PowerPC
	   Linux. MikMod tweaks. Changed version to 0.1.2.
