Building is pretty easy. Please read README, too, as it duplicates and
expands upon much of this information.


ALL PLATFORMS:

Please understand your rights and mine: read the text file COPYING in the root
of the source tree. If you can't abide by it, delete this source tree now.

The best documentation for the SDL_sound API is SDL_sound.h. It is VERY
heavily commented, and makes an excellent, in-depth reference to all the
functions.


UNIX:
 (If you pulled the source from CVS), run ./bootstrap

 run ./configure --help, and see if there's any options you need. Rerun
 configure with those options. If this is confusing to you, just run
 ./configure with no options: the defaults are generally decent, and
 configure is usually smart enough to figure out what's best..

 If configuration succeeded, run "make".

 Run "make install" as root to install the library for use on your system.

 This should work for most Unix-style systems, including Linux, *BSD, BeOS, and
 MacOS X. Reports of success and failure are welcome.


MacOS 9 users:
 Included with the source is CWProject.sit, which contains project files for
 CodeWarrior 5.0 and later.


MacOS X command line tools:
 You can use the "UNIX" instructions above if you like the command line tools.


MacOS X PowerBuilder:
 If you prefer to use PowerBuilder, download this file:
    http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/PBProjects.tar.gz
 ...and unpack it in the root of the SDL_sound folder. This archive contains
 several external libraries you would have to download/install manually if you
 used the command line tools (these libraries are for extra decoders, and are
 NOT required for SDL_sound to function...however, without them, the number of
 sound formats you can decode is reduced.)


Win32 Visual C:
 For Visual C, download
   http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/sdl_sound_visualc_srcs.zip
 ...and unzip it somewhere. This zipfile has a complete copy of the
 SDL_sound sources, Visual C project files, and several external libraries,
 too. This zip is everything you should need, and you can scrap this copy of
 the source.


Win32 Cygwin:
 Cygwin users can try their luck with the Unix build instructions in this
 tarball instead.



If building is successful, there will be a shared library and a binary
 called "playsound".



OTHER PLATFORMS:

Send me patches, and instructions, and I'll list them here. Consider 
joining the SDL_sound mailing list. Details are at:
