Left todo for 0.1.5:
- Update the Visual C project files.

General stuff TODO:
- Verify portability to various Unixes (BSD, etc)
- Port to MacOS Classic.
- Man pages for the API.

More immediate:
- Write a decent README.
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).
- Make some of the SNDDBG() strings more uniform.
- Run through ElectricFence, dmalloc, etc...
- Fix the crappy rewind implementation in shn.c's SHN_rewind().

Decoders to implement:
- .CDA (Does this need specific decoding? Or is a RWops needed?)
- An mpglib MP3 decoder? (or backend mpglib into SMPEG?)
- A c64 SID player?
- ...and more...

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
