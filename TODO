General stuff TODO:
- Use autoconf.
- Verify portability to various Unixes (BSD, etc)
- Port to Win32.
- Port to BeOS.
- Port to MacOS Classic.
- Port to MacOS X.

More immediate:
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).

Decoders to implement:
- .SHN
- .MID
- .CDA (Does this need specific decoding? Or is a RWops needed?)
- .AU
- An mpglib MP3 decoder? (or backend mpglib into SMPEG?)
- ...and more...

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
